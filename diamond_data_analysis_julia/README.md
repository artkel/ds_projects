# Diamond Dataset Analysis with Julia

## Project Aim
This project serves as a platform to learn and understand the basics of the Julia programming language particularly applied in data analysis. Through this project, I've explored various data analysis techniques ranging from basic data preparation to deploying machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from RDatasets, under the ggplot2 package titled 'diamonds'. It comprises prices of 50,000 round cut diamonds. The dataset has 53,940 rows and 10 columns providing various attributes of the diamonds. 

## Data Preparation
Initial steps involved data cleaning and preparation to ensure a smooth analysis process. This set the stage for the subsequent analytical steps.

## Univariate Data Analysis
The univariate analysis was conducted to understand the distribution and characteristics of individual variables. Basic visualizations were created to get a sense of the data.

## Multivariate Data Analysis
In the multivariate analysis phase, relationships between different variables were explored to glean insights on how they interact with each other.

## Machine Learning
Various machine learning algorithms were experimented with, to develop a model capable of predicting diamond prices based on the input variables.

## Functions File
All the functions used in the analysis can be found in a separate file named `functions.jl`, which helps in keeping the project organized and ensures code reusability.

Feel free to explore the repository and the analysis conducted. Your feedback and contributions are welcome.
